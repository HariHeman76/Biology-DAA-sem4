## **Protein Contact Prediction with Floyd-Warshall**  

### **Overview**  
Protein Contact Prediction is a computational biology problem that aims to determine which amino acid residues in a protein sequence are spatially close to each other in the 3D structure. This information is crucial for **protein folding, structure prediction, and drug discovery**. The **Floyd-Warshall algorithm**, a graph-based shortest path algorithm from **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, can be used to analyze contact maps and optimize protein structure prediction.

### **Relevance to Biology**  
- **Proteins & Structure:** Proteins are made of amino acids, and their function is largely determined by their 3D shape. **Contact maps** represent residue-residue proximity in this structure.  
- **Importance of Contact Prediction:**  
  - Helps in **predicting 3D structure** from amino acid sequences.  
  - Used in **drug design and molecular biology**.  
  - Supports understanding of **protein folding diseases** (e.g., Alzheimerâ€™s, Parkinsonâ€™s).

### **Relevance to Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**  
- **Graph Representation:**  
  - The **protein structure is modeled as a graph**, where **nodes** are amino acids and **edges** represent interactions between residues (if they are within a threshold distance).  
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:**  
  - A **Dynamic Programming (DP)** algorithm used for **finding shortest paths between all pairs of nodes** in a weighted graph.  
  - In this context, it helps **refine the contact map by ensuring the shortest inter-residue distances** in structural predictions.  
  - Computationally, it has **O(nÂ³) complexity**, where *n* is the number of amino acids.

### **How Floyd-Warshall Helps in Protein Contact Prediction**  
1. **Graph Construction:**  
   - Model the **protein contact map as a weighted graph** with residues as nodes.  
   - Weights represent **interaction strength or distance** between residues.  
2. **Path Optimization:**  
   - Use Floyd-Warshall to **refine and correct contact maps** by ensuring the most reliable shortest paths.  
   - Helps in **filtering false contacts and improving prediction accuracy**.  
3. **Integration with ML Models:**  
   - Floyd-Warshall can be used as a **post-processing step** to improve machine learning-based protein structure predictions.
